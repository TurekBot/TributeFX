/* This kind of replicates the glow effect that other controls get. Unfortunately, WebView isn't a Control, and
 so it doesn't have a -fx-background to use to make the glow effect. Maybe if you were to wrap it in something that
 was a Region (since Region *does* have the necessary properties) you could get it to glow the same.

 Until then, we'll just use a dropshadow effect that any old Node can have. */
